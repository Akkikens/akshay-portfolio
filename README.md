## ðŸš¨ About this repo (please read!)

### ðŸš€ Latest Update
I'm thrilled to see my portfolio gaining traction, with many daily visitors inspired by my work. Itâ€™s fantastic to share my code with the open-source community, and I appreciate everyone checking it out!

You can use this code for your website too. A note of credit linking back would be appreciated ðŸ˜Š. 

Please note that some design elements were inspired by Anaflous Abdellatif's portfolio, but all code was written from scratch. Technologies like `Tailwind CSS`, `Framer Motion`, and `Next.js` have been used to add unique touches, so while it may look similar, the underlying structure is completely original!

The `This website can't be reached` trick in my portfolio is an original, playful idea meant to engage visitors. Although itâ€™s unconventional, it adds a lighthearted element to the user experience.

A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase your work, projects, and skills. It serves as a dynamic, evergreen platform that can reflect your evolution as a developer. I chose Next.js for its server-side rendering, which benefits SEO, and Tailwind CSS for efficient styling that helps create responsive and visually appealing layouts.
